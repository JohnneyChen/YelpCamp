# YelpCamp

This is an express application created as the final project of the Web Developer Bootcamp course. It's built Express and MongoDB. Additionally, it leverages some external APIs for image uploads and clustermap generation. Additional features include form sanitation and other security measures, authorization and authentication using passport, and form validation.

To check out the app, please visit https://agile-cliffs-83809.herokuapp.com/. (Note, due to being deployed on a hobby dyno on heroku, the app will likely require some time before it loads. I thank you for your patience)
